# REDHAWK System Services

REDHAWK provides an optional RPM, `redhawk-adminservice`, to manage the REDHAWK core <abbr title="See Glossary.">services</abbr> (<abbr title="See Glossary.">Domain Manager</abbr>, <abbr title="See Glossary.">Device Manager</abbr>, and <abbr title="See Glossary.">waveforms</abbr>). These core services are managed as Linux system services using INI configuration files. The RPM is part of the REDHAWK yum repository; however, it is not installed by default.  Additional support files are included in the RPM to assist with tuning common operating system parameters and configuring the REDHAWK logging subsystem.

For more information about the AdminService and Linux support files, refer to the following:
