# Standardized Data Interfaces

Data flow between REDHAWK resources (<abbr title="See Glossary.">components</abbr> and <abbr title="See Glossary.">devices</abbr>) is managed through two sets of interfaces: Bulk Input/Output (BulkIO) and Burst Input/Output (BurstIO). The BulkIO module is designed for streaming data and maximizes the efficiency for bulk data transfers between resources, whereas, BurstIO is designed for <abbr title="See Glossary.">applications</abbr> that require small and possibly non-contiguous chunks of data transfers. Both interfaces also allow for the association of metadata, Signal Related Information (SRI), and a Precision Time Stamp, which describe the content being transferred in support of content processing. The following 3 sections detail the capabilities for both BulkIO and BurstIO implementations and the interfaces they provide.
