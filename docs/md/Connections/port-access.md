# Port Access

A <abbr title="See Glossary.">port</abbr> belongs to a <abbr title="See Glossary.">component</abbr> or <abbr title="See Glossary.">device</abbr> (devices are specialized components - see [Working With Devices](../Devices/_index.html) for additional information). To retrieve a port, an external entity needs to call `getPort()` on the component that owns that port. The argument to the `getPort()` function is the string name for the port, and the return value is a CORBA pointer to that port object. Both uses and provides ports are retrieved from components through this function call. Base supported interfaces are not retrieved through the `getPort()`, because they are not ports. Instead, these references are retrieved directly from an entity like the <abbr title="See Glossary.">Domain Manager</abbr> or the <abbr title="See Glossary.">Device Manager</abbr>.
