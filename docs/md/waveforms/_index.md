# Waveforms

This chapter discusses the construction and execution of <abbr title="See Glossary.">waveforms</abbr> within REDHAWK. An <abbr title="See Glossary.">application</abbr> is the software object that represents an instance of a waveform. A waveform is an XML file that describes the deployment, inter-connection, and configuration of <abbr title="See Glossary.">components</abbr>. It is possible to launch waveforms in the <abbr title="See Glossary.">sandbox</abbr> as well as in the REDHAWK <abbr title="See Glossary.">domain</abbr>. This chapter discusses the mechanisms for launching a waveform as a running application in a domain.
