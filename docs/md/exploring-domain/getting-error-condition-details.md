# Getting Details About Error Conditions

If an error condition occurs within the <abbr title="See Glossary.">Domain Manager</abbr> which prevents a <abbr title="See Glossary.">component</abbr>, <abbr title="See Glossary.">device</abbr>, Domain Manager, or <abbr title="See Glossary.">Device Manager</abbr> from running correctly, the object's representation in the <abbr title="See Glossary.">REDHAWK Explorer</abbr> is marked with a decorator in the lower left corner. Mouse hovering over the item's icon provides a short description of the issue; however, if more than one problem has occurred, the hover text reads "Multiple Problems exist with this item".
