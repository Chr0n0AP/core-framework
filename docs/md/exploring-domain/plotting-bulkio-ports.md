# Plotting BulkIO Ports

The REDHAWK IDE contains the ability to [plot](../ide/editors-and-views/redhawk-plot-view.html) using the NeXtMidas plotting framework. If the output <abbr title="See Glossary.">port</abbr> uses the Bulk Input/Output (BulkIO) interface, it can take advantage of this feature and plot a line graph or a falling raster.

To bring up a plot within the IDE:

1.  Make sure that the <abbr title="See Glossary.">component</abbr> is currently in the started state.

2.  Right-click the desired port to plot.

3.  Select either **Plot Port Data** or **Plot Port FFT**.

    A new view is created, and it contains the plot of the port's output data.


> **TIP**  
> The new view has the same name as the source port. To view additional source information, hover the mouse over the title.
