# Using Devices to Interface with FPGAs

Many Software-Defined Radio (SDR) systems depend on custom hardware solutions implemented on FPGAs and GPUs. REDHAWK has developed a design pattern to interface with these custom hardware solutions that enables users and the REDHAWK Framework alike to change the behavior of an FPGA at run-time to meet the needs of the application. Refer to [REDHAWK Persona Device Pattern](../appendices/persona-device-pattern.html) for more information.
