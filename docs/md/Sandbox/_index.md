# Sandbox

[Components can run](../components/running-a-component.html) in either the <abbr title="See Glossary.">sandbox</abbr> or in a <abbr title="See Glossary.">domain</abbr>. The sandbox is an environment to run <abbr title="See Glossary.">components</abbr> and <abbr title="See Glossary.">devices</abbr> without artifacts like a <abbr title="See Glossary.">Domain Manager</abbr>, <abbr title="See Glossary.">Device Manager</abbr>, <abbr title="See Glossary.">Name Service</abbr>, or <abbr title="See Glossary.">event service</abbr>.

REDHAWK provides two sandboxes, a Python-based one or an IDE-based one. The Python-based sandbox can run from any Python session on any system with a REDHAWK install. The IDE-based sandbox can host an instance of a Python-based sandbox, with both interlinked, allowing artifacts from the Python environment to interact with those on the graphical UI.
