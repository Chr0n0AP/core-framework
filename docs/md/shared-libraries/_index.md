# Shared Libraries

Shared libraries are a way to share common code between multiple REDHAWK projects, both at development and run time. When developing <abbr title="See Glossary.">components</abbr> or <abbr title="See Glossary.">devices</abbr>, REDHAWK shared libraries are automatically integrated into the build system. At run time, a component's dependencies are copied to the <abbr title="See Glossary.">GPP</abbr> as required, eliminating the need to install dependencies on each system in a <abbr title="See Glossary.">domain</abbr>.

Using shared libraries reduces the development, maintenance, and deployment costs of REDHAWK systems.
